# libgrafitti

A rewrite of Rune.js with more powerful color manipulation and built in color maps.

## Changes

- Deprecate color-convert and parse-color
- Extend the color utils.
- Extend the customizable object instance of `Grafitti`
- Add huetiful-js as a submodule
- Redesign generator functions or functions that work with collections to take Rune.Image instances as input. This could be a lib feature. 
- Asynchronous first approach to computationally expensive tasks
- Deprecate object assign. Try to keep core code only

### Chores

- Setup commitizen and documentation.js


#### Whacky ideas

Surfaces like the sky (dawn to dusk) , water or aurora etc can be mimicked.
